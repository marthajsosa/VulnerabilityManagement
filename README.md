<h1>JVulnerability Management</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
Set up a secure Azure network with an OpenVAS Vulnerability Management Scanner VM. Developed a vulnerable Windows 10 VM, featuring outdated software and disabled security controls. Performed unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans using OpenVAS. Analyzed scan results, highlighting the difference between unauthenticated and credentialed scans. Remediated identified vulnerabilities, verified successful remediation through subsequen scans. Created a list of remediable vulnerabilities to simulate realistic vulnerability remediation scenarios. 

Installed and configured Nessus Essnetials to perform credentialed vulnerability scans against Windows 10 Hosts. Implemented Vulnerability Management Function on sandbox networks: discover, prioritize, assess, report, remediate, verify. Conducted vulnerability assessments with Nessus: remediated vulnerabilities. Developed automated remediation process to preemptively  deal with vulnerabilities stemming from Windows updates and third-party software.
